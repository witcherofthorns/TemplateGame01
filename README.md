## Template Game 01
This is my example of the implementation of a simple game, this project does not carry anything special.<br>
I will be glad if this project becomes educational for you, you can use it :)<br>
I will try to complete this project, but I do not promise it<br>
All materials, sprites and textures were found in the public domain and were used for informational purposes only<br><br>
